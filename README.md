# Coursera - Getting And Cleaning Data
This repository provides my R history from the subject course. The course website is located here: https://class.coursera.org/getdata-013/auth

Included in this repository are scripts for the weekly lectures as well as the quizzes and some saved code from the swirl programming assignment that accompanied the course.

The course project is also included as a sub-folder.
